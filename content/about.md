I’m a multifaceted three-dimensional human being with my own set of beliefs, ideals and reasoning.  
<br>
I love to create. It honestly doesn’t matter what the medium is, I just love creating. The act of conceptualizing something and then guiding it to fruition with your own two hands is exhilarating.  
<br>
I resent the idea of a filter, I don’t want to conform to somebody else’s idea of who or what I should be. I just want to remain true to myself and my own identity.  
<br>
I don’t like attaching labels to peoples or things, it’s why I despise trying to describe myself. I want my work and my creations to speak to the world about who I am and what I can do.
