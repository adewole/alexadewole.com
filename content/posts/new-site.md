I've legitimately spent like the last month or so going through iteration after iteration of a personal site.
I really do hope that is the last one for awhile. Anyways, here's each version (that I could find) in sequential order, perhaps maybe you can use or improve the design for your own purpose.

### #1. The Zoomer

This one was quite cool. I really liked the use of emojis, but ultimately I decided to try again.


### #2. The Minimalist

I **really** liked this one. It was extremely minimialistic and clean, it didn't strain your eyes and allowed the typography to shine. However, it was a little *too* minimalistic and I opted to try again.

### #3. The ???

Let's not speak about this one.

### #4. Quarter-age crisis

This is the only other site that I ended up putting live on this domain. When I first designed it, I really liked it. In retrospect, there's just so much that hurts my brain. This one also burnt the fuck out of my friend's eyes when I linked him it at 2 AM due to all the whitespace.

### #5. The One üòç

My current site and favorite. This one has both a dark mode and a light mode version. There's no current way to pick one or the other and it's instead derived from your OS. The source code to this one is available [here](https://github.com/adewole/alexadewole.com). **I hope you love it as much as I do!**
