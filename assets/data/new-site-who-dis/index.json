Anyways, here's each version (that I could find) in sequential order, perhaps maybe you can use or improve the design for your own purpose.</p>\n<h3 id=\"1-the-zoomer\"><a href=\"#1-the-zoomer\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>#1. The Zoomer</h3>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/f35eONo.png\" alt=\"Mach I\">\nThis one was quite cool. I really liked the use of emojis, but ultimately I decided to try again.</p>\n<h3 id=\"2-the-minimalist\"><a href=\"#2-the-minimalist\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>#2. The Minimalist</h3>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/gjcjiuJ.png\" alt=\"Mach II\">\nI <strong>really</strong> liked this one. It was extremely minimialistic and clean, it didn't strain your eyes and allowed the typography to shine. However, it was a little <em>too</em> minimalistic and I opted to try again.</p>\n<h3 id=\"3-the-\"><a href=\"#3-the-\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>#3. The ???</h3>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/PEztcjy.png\" alt=\"Mach III\">\nLet's not speak about this one.</p>\n<h3 id=\"4-quarter-age-crisis\"><a href=\"#4-quarter-age-crisis\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>#4. Quarter-age crisis</h3>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/TpXs2tE.png\" alt=\"Mach IV\">\nThis is the only other site that I ended up putting live on this domain. When I first designed it, I really liked it. In retrospect, there's just so much that hurts my brain. This one also burnt the fuck out of my friend's eyes when I linked him it at 2 AM due to all the whitespace.</p>\n<h3 id=\"5-the-one-\"><a href=\"#5-the-one-\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>#5. The One üòç</h3>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/nf82t0v.png\" alt=\"Mach V\">\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/ydhGgwT.png\" alt=\"Mach V\">\nMy current site and favorite. This one has both a dark mode and a light mode version. There's no current way to pick one or the other and it's instead derived from your OS. The source code to this one is available <a href=\"https://github.com/adewole/alexadewole.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">here</a>. <strong>I hope you love it as much as I do!</strong></p>\n"}},"context":{}}
